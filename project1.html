<h3>Background</h3>
<p>This site was created as a personal project to showcase my ability to code Fluid web design.
For this purpose I fabricated a streaming company called Media Offine. Media o ine has
been creating a space for independent  lmmakers to post their work online. This space is
meant to join both established content and new risk taking material mainly submitted
online. It is important that their site functions on any screen available to the public as well as
modern responsive code that makes sure their viewing experience can compete with the
likes of Net ix and Hulu.</p>
</br>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>I would like a streaming site to compete with other established streaming services. I would
like this site to work well with any screen, as well as create a visual identity that stands out
from our competitors.</p>
</br>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>To start this process I looked at established sites, and decided what worked best, and what
could be changed. I then started creating color Palets and sorting through text options to
see what would make the site look di erent, while still being visibly appealing.
</p>
</br>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The client was able to provide a functional accessible site that allowed their end users to
experience their content not only through a laptop but also tablets, and mobile devices. This
allowed them to o er more options and attract more people into their services.
The visual update allowed them to stand out against competitors as well as create a visual
identity for their company.
