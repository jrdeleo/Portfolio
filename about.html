	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I grew up in many places. When i was young my mother would take me home
to her family in mexico each summer. When i was five we moved to South
Korea for my step fathers job. When we returned we moved around much of
the United states. I have the opportunity to take in a lot of influences, and it is
something i bring into my work at every level. I enjoy working with those
different than me, allowing new ideas to influence my own. When i work on a
site, a enjoy taking elements from places that may not be related, or from
others I am collaborating with.
